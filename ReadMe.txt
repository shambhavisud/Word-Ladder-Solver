Word Ladder




Necessary Steps 
1. It's very much necessary that all the files, the .c , .h and txt files are stored in the same folder.
2. Give the command for compilation
3. You will be prompted twice to enter a starting word and final word.
4. Make sure the words are enter in Lower Case
5. Make sure there are no spaces\gaps in a word.
6. A Word-Ladder DOES NOT exist between two words of different lengths, so it would be best if you enter two words of similar lengths.
7. DO NOT enter any special characters or symbols.
8. If it’s an invalid word, or a word not present in the txt file, you’ll be prompted to enter another word.
9. Press Enter to exit the program.
